Plates and cases
================

[This simple plate](../plates/plate.stl) works for both v1 and v2.
It has no support or screw inserts, so not ideal for hotswap
builds, but does the job.

## V2

This is the basically the same plate with a few supports
placed where the mounting holes are. I have not tested to
actually screw this on, Im just using it without screws:
[left plate with supports](../plates/cheapino-plate-left.stl)
[right plate with supports](../plates/cheapino-plate-right.stl)

This is a case I made, very compact, almost no empty space inside:

## V2 Sandwich Case

There’s also a sandwich case design that you can order together with the main PCB. It’s important to order the top plate with the default 1.6 mm thickness so that it clicks firmly into the MX switches. The top plate is held in place by the switches and doesn’t require spacers or screws for securing.

The bottom plate has mounting holes aligned with the main PCB and can be secured using 7 mm long M2 flathead screws and nuts. In this setup, the bottom plate sits tightly against the sockets. Example parts from AliExpress:
